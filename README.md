# Console Wordle - Python Edition

A simple **Wordle** clone built with Python for the command line. Guess the hidden 5-letter word within 6 attempts, and get feedback after each guess!

---

## ðŸŽ® Features

- A word is randomly chosen from a word list (`words.txt`)
- The user has 6 attempts to guess the 5-letter word
- After each guess, the program outputs:
  - âœ… for correct letters in the correct position
  - ðŸŸ¨ for correct letters in the wrong position
  - â¬› for incorrect letters

Letter counting is handled precisely to avoid over-highlighting duplicate letters.
